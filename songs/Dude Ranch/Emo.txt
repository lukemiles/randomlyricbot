One more time you will laugh about it
And he'll never try to give you more
And I don't care, he is such a dick
Treats you like you are a stupid whore
And it seems like things will never change
You go on, every cloud is in your way
And I know you feel empty all the time
You'll never listen to anything that I sa
She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more
Why leave when you claim it is love?
But why stay when you're not the only one?
She's proved she's strong
Be brave, be strong
She's better off sleeping on the floor
'Cause she fell right off when all
Is said, you know
It's okay to just want more
She's better off sleeping on the floor
