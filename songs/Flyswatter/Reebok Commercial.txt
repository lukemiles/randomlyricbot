You are better than me, girls, money, and everything
I try to compete with you,
but you beat me at everything I do
I see in you the things that I would like to be
But I'm different from you,
So you will have to be like me!
I cannot be bought my personality is what I choose
I was brought up without a silver cup I won't
covet the things owned by you
For all the world material things are now more and more
jealousy for you and me
I won't covet the things owned by your store
