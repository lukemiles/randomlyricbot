He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set her credit cards are paying the funds
He's not that old, I've been told a strong sexual goal
He goes out everyday she goes every way oh yeah
And they don't even care at all
She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way to unhealthy
Often they've typically
Been starved for attention before
She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way it felt
He wants to bone this I know she is ready to blow
They go out every night his pants are super tight oh yeah
And they don't even care at all
She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically
Been starved for attention before
