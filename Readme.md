randomlyricbot
=================================
A bot I wrote to tweet random lyrics, in this case Blink-182 lyrics.

The script first picks a song, then a random line from the song. It tweets the random line.
Additionally, it strips the filename and extension of the file and uses that as the song name. It makes that the twitter location.

This is a very specific project. If you can use some of the code to meet your needs, great.
